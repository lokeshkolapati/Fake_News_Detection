# 📰 Fake News Detection 

## 📌 Overview
The spread of **fake news** on social media platforms poses a serious threat to public trust, democracy, and information integrity.  
Our project leverages **Machine Learning** to detect fake news **directly from the text content** of news articles, providing a smarter alternative to outdated blacklists of fake news sources.

Instead of rigidly checking articles against pre-labeled fake news lists, we train a **text classification model** that can **predict whether a news source is likely to produce fake news** based on multiple articles from that source.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Help social media platforms reduce the visibility of potentially fake content by assigning **visibility weights** to articles.

## 🚀 Problem Definition
Traditional fake news detection methods (checking against static lists) are **inflexible** and **easy to bypass**.  
Our ML-driven approach:

- Trains on a **corpus of labeled news articles** (real and fake).
- Classifies the likelihood of a **news source** being fake based on multiple articles.
- Reduces **misclassification errors** by focusing on **source-level detection**.
- Outputs predictions that can be integrated into **social media ranking algorithms**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**  
- HTML, CSS (Templates: `index.html`, `prediction.html`)

**Backend**  
- Python (Flask)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML Models)
- Pickle (`finalized_model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`)

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   - A labeled dataset (`news.csv`) containing both real and fake news articles is used.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using **TF-IDF**.

3. **Model Training**  
   - ML algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes) trained on the dataset.
   - Model saved as `finalized_model.pkl` and vectorizer as `vectorizer.pkl`.

4. **Prediction Pipeline**  
   - Flask backend loads model & vectorizer.
   - User submits article text.
   - Model predicts if the news is **Real** or **Fake**.
